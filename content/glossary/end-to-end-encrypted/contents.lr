definition:

Transmitted data which is [encrypted](../encryption) directly from origin to destination (to exclude third party management) is called end-to-end encryption. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) relies on an exchange of public keys (used to encrypt). A separate complimentary private key decrypts data/messages for reading by intended party only (end-to-end-encrypted).
